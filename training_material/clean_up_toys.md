## Module 2: Preparation

### 1. Understanding Your Child’s Preferences and Abilities

Before guiding a parent through helping their child clean up toys, consider:
- **Age:** Younger children (ages 2-3) may need more direct assistance, while older children (ages 4-5) can take on more responsibility.
- **Attention Span:** Children may lose interest quickly, so it’s important to suggest fun and manageable activities that keep their focus.

## Module 3: Step-by-Step Toy Clean-Up Guidance

### 1. Start with Encouragement and Setting Expectations

**Scenario:** The room is cluttered with toys, and the parent needs guidance on how to encourage their child to clean up.

- **Caregiver Prompt for Parents:** “You’ve been having so much fun! Now it’s time to clean up all the toys together.”
- **Set a Positive Tone:** Encourage parents to use an upbeat, enthusiastic tone to make the task feel like part of playtime. Avoid making it seem like a chore.

### 2. Organizing the Task into Manageable Steps

#### Step 1: Gather the Most Used Toys First

**Scenario:** The child is unsure where to start cleaning.

- **Caregiver Prompt for Parents:** “Let’s start by picking up all the cars. Can you find all the red cars and put them in this bin?”

#### Step 2: Sorting Toys into Bins

**Scenario:** The child has multiple types of toys to organize.

- **Caregiver Prompt for Parents:** “Do you see that big bin over there? Let’s put all the dolls and stuffed animals inside it.”
- **Demonstrate Sorting:** Suggest parents show their child how to group toys by type or size to make organizing easier. This also helps with early categorization skills.

### 3. Encouraging Participation and Creativity

#### Scenario 1: The child is reluctant to clean up.

    Clean up, clean up, everybody do your share!” 🎵

- **Caregiver Prompt for Parents:** “It’s great that [sibling’s name] wants to help! How about you both work together? [Child’s name], you can collect all the toy cars, and [sibling’s name], you can gather the stuffed animals.”
