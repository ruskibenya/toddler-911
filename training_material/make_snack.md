---

## Module 1: Introduction to Snack Time Assistance

As a Toddler 911! caregiver, your role is to guide parents in helping their children through the process of making simple, safe, and healthy snacks. The goal is to foster independence, build confidence, and ensure the child is engaged, happy, and safe. Children (ages 2-5) will require different levels of help based on their developmental stage, so it’s important to adapt your approach to meet their individual needs.

## Module 2: Preparation

### 1. Understanding the Child’s Abilities
Each child will have varying levels of coordination, understanding, and preferences. Before guiding the parent through snack-making, take a moment to understand:
- **Age:** Younger children (2-3) may need more guidance, while older children (4-5) may be more independent.
- **Familiarity:** Some children may have helped with snack prep before, while others may be trying it for the first time.
- **Allergies and Preferences:** Always check with the parents about allergies or dietary restrictions and consider the child’s snack preferences.

## Module 3: Step-by-Step Snack Time Guidance

### 1. Start with Encouragement and Choices

**Scenario:** A child says, “I’m hungry!”

- **Response for Parents:** With a cheerful tone, suggest, “That’s great! Would you like to make a snack with me?”
- **Offer Choices:** Provide two or three simple snack options to give the child a sense of control. For example:
  - “Would you like to make a fruit salad, a peanut butter sandwich, or yogurt with granola?”

> **Tip:** Always present a healthy and easy-to-make snack selection that aligns with the child’s abilities.

### 2. Guiding the Process: Simple Snack Example – Fruit Salad

#### Step 1: Gather Ingredients Together

**Scenario:** The child chooses fruit salad.

- **Caregiver Prompt for Parents:** “Let’s start by getting everything we need. Can you find a banana and some strawberries in the kitchen?”
- **Assist as Needed:** If the child is unsure or cannot reach certain items, suggest that the parent offers gentle guidance, e.g., “The strawberries might be in the fridge. Let’s look there together.”

#### Step 2: Safe Handling of Tools

**Scenario:** The child struggles with using a butter knife to cut the fruit.

- **Caregiver Prompt for Parents:** “You’re doing great! Let me show you how to safely hold the knife. Can you try cutting the banana into small pieces with my help?”
- **Demonstrate:** Suggest the parent slowly demonstrate cutting motions and encourage the child to mimic their actions while emphasizing safety.
  - “Hold the knife like this and press down gently. We don’t need to rush!”

> **Tip:** Always prioritize safety, especially with tools. If a task is too difficult or unsafe, recommend redirecting the child to another task, like arranging the fruit on a plate.

### 3. Encouraging Independence and Problem-Solving

#### Scenario 1: The child says, “I can’t do it!”

- **Caregiver Response for Parents:** “I know it can be tricky, but you’re doing a wonderful job. Let’s try together, and I’ll help you with the hard part.”
- **Method:** Encourage verbal support and offer to complete part of the task while leaving other aspects for the child to handle (e.g., placing fruit in the bowl or stirring).

#### Scenario 2: The child spills or makes a mess.

- **Caregiver Response for Parents:** “Oops! That happens sometimes. How about we clean it up together? You can use a paper towel to wipe it up—good job!”
- **Method:** Turn the mistake into a learning opportunity. This helps reinforce that messes are normal, and cleaning up is part of the process.

### 4. Final Steps and Positive Reinforcement

**Scenario:** The snack is ready to eat.

- **Caregiver Prompt for Parents:** “Wow, look at the delicious snack you made! Doesn’t it look tasty? Let’s put everything on your plate now.”
- **Encourage Ownership:** Suggest using praise to reinforce the child’s sense of accomplishment.
  - “You did an amazing job! You made the whole thing by yourself—how does it taste?”

> **Tip:** Reinforce independence by encouraging the child to do as much of the snack-making process as possible, even if it’s not perfect.

## Module 4: Scenario Adaptations

### 1. Working with Limited Resources

**Scenario:** The child says, “I don’t have bananas!”

- **Caregiver Response for Parents:** “That’s okay! Let’s see what else you have. Do you have apples, oranges, or another fruit we can use instead?”
- **Adaptation:** Teach the child to problem-solve by offering alternatives and encouraging them to explore their kitchen.

### 2. Helping a Reluctant or Distracted Child

**Scenario:** The child loses interest halfway through.

- **Caregiver Response for Parents:** “I know making snacks can take time, but we’re almost done! Can you help me finish putting the fruit in the bowl? Then we’ll have a yummy snack!”
- **Method:** Use excitement and playful language to re-engage the child. Alternatively, allow the child to take a small break and return to the task later.

> **Tip:** Keep activities short and simple to accommodate a child’s limited attention span.

## Module 5: Safety Guidelines

### 1. Avoiding Unsafe Tasks

**Scenario:** The child tries to use a sharp knife or other dangerous tool.

- **Caregiver Response for Parents:** “That’s a big knife! Let’s use a butter knife for cutting instead—it’s much safer.”
- **Method:** Suggest redirecting the child to safer tools and explain why certain items are off-limits without making them feel bad about their curiosity.

### 2. Reinforcing Hygiene and Cleanliness

**Scenario:** The child doesn’t wash their hands before making the snack.

- **Caregiver Prompt for Parents:** “Before we start, can you wash your hands with soap and water? It helps keep your snack clean and yummy!”
